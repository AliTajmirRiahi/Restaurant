# Restaurant
Restaurant is a clean‑architecture–based .NET 10 application designed to manage restaurant operations with a scalable, maintainable, and testable structure.

The project follows Domain‑Driven Design (DDD), CQRS principles, and a layered architecture separating Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation concerns.

The solution includes dedicated layers for contracts, services, and integration/unit testing to ensure high code quality and long‑term maintainability.
